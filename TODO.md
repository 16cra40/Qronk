# TO DO

- Adjust servo revolute joint limits and dynamics
- Calculate inertial values using Fusion 360 with new material and mass; might need to add servos to URDF
- Gazebo currently does not load the meshes (spawn_robot only brings in sphere, after very long delay)
- Add controls for joints (inverse kinematics)
